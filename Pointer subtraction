//The difference between the two pointers tells us how far p is from the start of str in terms of characters.
//                                                             p - str  →  (address(p) - address(str)) / sizeof(char)
//In C/C++, subtracting two pointers that point into the same array (here, the same character array str) gives the number of elements between them.  sizeof(char) is 1 byte
//                                                             p - str  →  1016 - 1000 = 16
//program prints 16 — the starting index (0-based) of "live" in the string.
//                                                             (p - str + 1)
//human readable indexing is 1 based indexing
/*
Mathematics in short:

          Pointer difference → (address difference) / sizeof(element type)
          Since here sizeof(char) = 1, pointer difference = character index.
