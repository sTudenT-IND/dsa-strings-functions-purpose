//You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

//Examples :

//Input: s = "abba"
//Output: true
//Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

class Solution {
  public:
    bool isPalindrome(string& s) {
        // code here
        //string ko reverese kr k store in another string s2 
        // copy initial string in s1 //now compare s1 and s2 
        // return s1 == s2; this will give itself true or false
        
        
        //initializing string using constructor
        string s1(s);
        
        //copying 
        string s2 = s1;
        
        //reverse the string s2 directly, don't copy it in s3
        reverse(s2.begin(), s2.end());
        
        //compare both the strings and return the ans in true and false
        return (s2==s1);
    }
};
